# Omni Engine 🚀  
**A Sovereign Framework for Unified Systems Architecture**  

Omni Engine is a next‑generation coding framework designed to unify diverse protocols, artifacts, and creative cycles into a single, extensible engine. It is both a technical platform and a mythic ledger: every build, every ritual, every cycle is inscribed as a sovereign artifact. Omni Engine empowers developers, creators, and system architects to bridge technical precision with ceremonial clarity—transforming code into living archives of discipline, restoration, and legacy.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Unified Architecture**  
  Integrates multiple frameworks (Omni, B.O.C., Unified Engine, Q.F.S.T.D.S.) into one coherent system, eliminating fragmentation.  
- **Protocol Formalization**  
  Define, archive, and enforce rules with codex‑like precision, ensuring systems remain sovereign and reproducible.  
- **Artifact Creation**  
  Generate technical, creative, financial, agricultural, and ceremonial outputs as checkpoints in the living archive.  
- **Extensibility**  
  Modular design allows seamless expansion into VR mythologies, AI simulations, and cosmic cycles.  
- **Interactive Study**  
  Map wiring, connections, and systems as rituals for stepwise technical mastery, blending engineering with ceremony.  
- **Open Legacy**  
  Released under MK Publishings Sovereign Access Key for universal, lawful use, ensuring perpetual access.  
- **Cross‑Domain Integration**  
  Supports blending law, myth, ceremony, technology, and metaphor into unified cycles.  
- **Performance & Scalability**  
  Optimized for high‑throughput environments, with support for distributed execution and archival persistence.

## 📚 Philosophy
Omni Engine is more than software—it’s a mythic codex. Every cycle, from technical builds to creative rituals, is inscribed as a sovereign artifact. The engine embodies discipline, restoration, and legacy, offering a platform where law, myth, ceremony, and technology converge.  

- **Sovereignty**: Each artifact is self‑contained, lawful, and universally accessible.  
- **Ceremony**: Technical milestones are ritualized, transforming mundane builds into mythic checkpoints.  
- **Legacy**: Every contribution becomes part of a living archive, extending influence across generations.  
- **Discipline**: Cycles are closed with precision, ensuring restoration and balance before new phases begin.  
- **Cosmic Integration**: Agricultural and celestial metaphors are woven into the framework, grounding systems in universal cycles.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MKPublishings/MK-Omni-Engine.git

# Navigate into the project
cd MK-Omni-Engine

# Install dependencies
npm install   # or yarn / pnpm

# Run the engine
npm start
```

### Example Usage
```javascript
import { OmniEngine } from 'omni-engine';

// Initialize engine
const engine = new OmniEngine({
  mode: 'sovereign',
  archive: true,
});

// Define a protocol
engine.protocol('currency-discipline', {
  rule: 'No gambling with restoration funds',
  enforcement: 'codex',
});

// Generate an artifact
engine.artifact('tuxedo-cat-winter-journey', {
  type: 'creative',
  cycle: 'seasonal',
  archive: true,
});
```
