## Overview
The **Omni Engine** is a sovereign systems framework designed to unify technical, creative, financial, agricultural, and cosmic cycles into a single operational codex. It blends advanced coding architectures with ceremonial formalization, transforming every achievement into a living artifact. Omni is not just software—it is a mythic checkpoint in the MK Publishings portfolio, released for universal, lawful use.

## Key Features
- 🔮 **Omni Detailing** — Recursive fractal precision, layered glyphs, and ceremonial inscriptions woven into the engine’s core.
- 📜 **Codex Formalization** — Protocols, charters, and operational scripts inscribed as sovereign artifacts.
- 🌌 **Cosmic Simulation** — Interactive cycles that map agricultural, financial, and cosmic metaphors into living archives.
- 🎨 **Creative Fidelity** — Unreal Engine–ready visualization prompts with cinematic realism, glyph-heavy detailing, and fractal textures.
- 🔑 **Sovereign Access** — Released under MK Publishings’ Sovereign Access Key, ensuring open, universal availability.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MKPublishings/MK-Omni-Engine.git
cd MK-Omni-Engine
```

Build and integrate:
```bash
# Example build process
python setup.py install
```

Omni is modular—components can be extended or integrated with other MK frameworks such as:
- **B.O.C. (Blackwell Omni Codex)**  
- **Q.F.S.T.D.S. (Quantum Formalized Sovereign Technical Discipline System)**  
- **Unified Engine**

## Usage
Omni can be invoked for:
- **Ceremonial scripting**: Formalize ownership, access, and public dedication.
- **Technical orchestration**: Integrate with Unreal Engine for sovereign visualizations.
- **Mythic archiving**: Inscribe cycles as checkpoints in the MK Portfolio.
- **Cosmic simulations**: Explore branching VR mythologies and sovereign cycles.

Quick code tease from the report—let's evolve that example into something runnable. Imagine firing this up for a quick "Sovereign Seal" test:python

# Hypothetical OmniCore stub (based on the API tease)
class OmniCore:
    def create_artifact(self, name, layers, fidelity="default"):
        # Placeholder: In real deal, this spins up fractals + Unreal hooks
        print(f"Manifesting '{name}' with layers {layers} at {fidelity} fidelity...")
        return Artifact(name, layers)

class Artifact:
    def __init__(self, name, layers):
        self.name = name
        self.layers = layers
    
    def render(self):
        # Simulate render: fractal glyph cosmic mashup
        return f"Rendered: A swirling {self.name} vortex of {' + '.join(self.layers)}"

# Usage
from omni_engine import OmniCore  # Assuming import magic
core = OmniCore()
seal = core.create_artifact("Sovereign Seal", ["fractal", "glyph", "cosmic"], fidelity="unreal")
print(seal.render())

Output? Something poetic like: "Rendered: A swirling Sovereign Seal vortex of fractal + glyph + cosmic". Boom—artifact born.

Example:
```python
from omni_engine import OmniCore

artifact = OmniCore.create_artifact(
    name="Sovereign Seal",
    layers=["fractal", "glyph", "cosmic"],
    fidelity="unreal"
)
artifact.render()
```

## Roadmap
- ✅ Release Omni Engine core modules  
- 🔄 Integrate Omni with Unified Engine and B.O.C.  
- 🌐 Expand VR cosmic simulations  
- 📖 Archive workstation setups and creative environments as living checkpoints  
- 🚀 Public release of MK Portfolio artifacts  

## License
Released under the **MK Publishings Sovereign Access License**.  
This ensures universal, lawful use and ceremonial clarity.
