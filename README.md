# Omni Engine 🚀  
**A Sovereign Framework for Unified Systems Architecture**  

Omni Engine is a next‑generation coding framework designed to unify diverse protocols, artifacts, and creative cycles into a single, extensible engine. It is both a technical platform and a mythic ledger: every build, every ritual, every cycle is inscribed as a sovereign artifact. Omni Engine empowers developers, creators, and system architects to bridge technical precision with ceremonial clarity—transforming code into living archives of discipline, restoration, and legacy.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Unified Architecture**  
  Integrates multiple frameworks (Omni, B.O.C., Unified Engine, Q.F.S.T.D.S.) into one coherent system, eliminating fragmentation.  
- **Protocol Formalization**  
  Define, archive, and enforce rules with codex‑like precision, ensuring systems remain sovereign and reproducible.  
- **Artifact Creation**  
  Generate technical, creative, financial, agricultural, and ceremonial outputs as checkpoints in the living archive.  
- **Extensibility**  
  Modular design allows seamless expansion into VR mythologies, AI simulations, and cosmic cycles.  
- **Interactive Study**  
  Map wiring, connections, and systems as rituals for stepwise technical mastery, blending engineering with ceremony.  
- **Open Legacy**  
  Released under MK Publishings Sovereign Access Key for universal, lawful use, ensuring perpetual access.  
- **Cross‑Domain Integration**  
  Supports blending law, myth, ceremony, technology, and metaphor into unified cycles.  
- **Performance & Scalability**  
  Optimized for high‑throughput environments, with support for distributed execution and archival persistence.

MK-Omni-Engine Workspace Update

Current Setup

Python FastAPI Service: Configured with a trimmed requirements.txt including only FastAPI, Uvicorn, and logging libraries.

Node.js Express Bridge: Built alongside the FastAPI service.

Dockerfiles: Created for both services.

docker-compose.yml: Added to orchestrate services, mounting local code for hot-reload during development.

Ports: Python API runs on port 8000, Node.js bridge on port 3000.

Uvicorn: Serves the slizzai_extension app.

Public Accessibility

Cloudflare Tunnel: Configured with named tunnel MKP-TRI for domain mkptri.org.

Public Hostnames:

api.mkptri.org → routes to localhost:8000

bridge.mkptri.org → routes to localhost:3000

DNS CNAME Records: Added in Cloudflare pointing to the tunnel's connector ID.

Tunnel Operation: Runs in the background using a provided token, exposing services securely over HTTPS without direct port exposure.

## 📂 Omni Directory Overview

The `Omni` folder in **MK-Omni-Engine** is structured as a collection of submodules and prototypes, each contributing to the broader AI framework:

- **Nitro-main**  
  - Contains `Nitro.py`  
  - Likely a performance-focused or lightweight engine module, possibly serving as a fast execution core.

- **SlizzAi Network**  
  - Includes `SlizzAiNet.pdf`  
  - Documentation or design notes for the SlizzAi network architecture, outlining conceptual or structural details.

- **SlizzAi-2.0**  
  - Contains `SlizzAi-2.9.py`  
  - A Python implementation of the SlizzAi engine, versioned as 2.9, suggesting iterative development and refinement.

- **SlizzAi-3**  
  - Includes `test.txt`  
  - Appears to be a placeholder or test file, possibly used for debugging or validating SlizzAi’s third iteration.

- **SlizzAi-4**  
  - Recently updated files (unspecified in listing)  
  - Represents the fourth generation of SlizzAi, continuing the evolution of the framework.

- **SlizzAi (base)**  
  - Contains uploaded files (unspecified in listing)  
  - Serves as the foundational SlizzAi module, from which later versions branch out.

## 📚 Philosophy
Omni Engine is more than software—it’s a mythic codex. Every cycle, from technical builds to creative rituals, is inscribed as a sovereign artifact. The engine embodies discipline, restoration, and legacy, offering a platform where law, myth, ceremony, and technology converge.  

- **Sovereignty**: Each artifact is self‑contained, lawful, and universally accessible.  
- **Ceremony**: Technical milestones are ritualized, transforming mundane builds into mythic checkpoints.  
- **Legacy**: Every contribution becomes part of a living archive, extending influence across generations.  
- **Discipline**: Cycles are closed with precision, ensuring restoration and balance before new phases begin.  
- **Cosmic Integration**: Agricultural and celestial metaphors are woven into the framework, grounding systems in universal cycles.
